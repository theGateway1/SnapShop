# [The 4 PM Store](https://4pmstore.d3ecocrh7z4pdj.amplifyapp.com/)
An E-Commerce full-stack web application built on MERN stack to showcase my work that uses production grade best practices. It uses latest version of React & Node JS (as of April 2024). To make sure you can walk through my thought process, <b>the project is open source since the first line of code</b>, and progresses further through schema updates, optimizations and bug fixes, it's a journey from ideation to deployment.
