# The 4 PM Store
An E-Commerce full-stack web application built on MERN stack to showcase my work that uses production grade best practices. It uses latest version of React & Node JS (as of April 2024). To make sure you can walk through my thought process, <b>the project is open source since the first line of code</b>, and progresses further through schema updates, optimizations and bug fixes, it's a journey from ideation to deployment (very soon!). 

<b>The project will be deployed very soon, I'm still working on some features.</b> Until then, I've attached some screenshots here.

#### That's all for now, thanks for shopping ;)

### Wait, before you go...
I'll highly encourage you to go through the code, on the outset, <b>it might look like any other E-Commerce application out there, but the code will change your mind</b>. Methods & components have been described extensively as comments using [js-doc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc), and broken out in pieces to prevent redundancy and serve singular purpose. The screenshots have been taken on my PC, but, it is responsive to all screen sizes out there.
